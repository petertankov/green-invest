The python files are designed to run from Jupyter notebooks. To test the code open the notebooks optimal_entry_figures.ipynb or optimal_exit_figures.ipynb and execute the cells one by one

All required data files are provided, but if necessary, the ngfs scenario data files can be recreated from original csv files from NGFS scenario explorer using the notebook read_ngfs_data.ipynb
